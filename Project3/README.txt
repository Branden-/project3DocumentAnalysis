1.  Who is in your group?

2.  How long did the project take?

3.  Before you started, which data structure did you expect would be the fastest

4.  Which data structure is the fastest? Why were you right or wrong?

5.  In general, which DataCounter dictionary implementation was "better":
    trees or hash tables? Note that you will need to define "better" (
    ease of coding, ease of debugging, memory usage, disk access patterns,
    runtime for average input, runtime for all input, etc).

6.  Are there cases in which a particular data structure performs really
    well or badly in the correlator? Enumerate the cases for each data
    structure.

7.  Give a one or two paragraph explanation of whether or not you think
    Bacon wrote Shakespeare's plays based on the data you collected. No
    fancy statiscal analysis here (formal analysis comes later); keep
    it fun and simple.

8.  Writeup your benchmarks (this is long). Your mission is to convince
